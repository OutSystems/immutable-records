# immutable-records
A simple implementation of immutable records for JavaScript.

The goal of this implementation is to have great performance dealing with
records with a small, fixed set of attributes. [See here](https://medium.com/outsystems-engineering/javascript-and-immutability-how-fast-is-fast-enough-27790cda4e9e#.4xf0eiq4m) for a performance comparision with Facebook's [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

This is the JavaScript version of the [TypeScript](https://github.com/OutSystems/immutable-records) version for use with npm.
