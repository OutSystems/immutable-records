# immutable-records
A simple implementation of immutable records for JavaScript.

The goal of this implementation is to have great performance dealing with
records with a small, fixed set of attributes.

If you want to try the code but don't feel like using TypeScript, you can
use the [online compiler][typescript-playground] to convert it.
